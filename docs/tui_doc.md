## Script Documentation

**1. Script Name:** torus_analyzer.py (The actual name may vary)

**2. Description:** 

This Python script provides a text-based user interface (TUI) for analyzing the strength of a torus shape. It offers a menu-driven system to access various analysis modules located within the "modules" directory. The script leverages the `curses` library for interactive terminal control.

**3. Usage:** 

Run the script from the command line using:

```bash
python torus_analyzer.py
```

**4. Parameters:** 

This script does not accept any command-line parameters.

**5. Functions and their purposes:**

* **`load_modules()`:**
    * Scans the "modules" directory for Python files (excluding those starting with "__").
    * Dynamically imports each module and checks for a function named "run_analysis".
    * If found, it stores the function reference in a dictionary with the module name (beautified) as the key.
    * Returns the dictionary of analysis modules.
* **`main_menu(stdscr)`:**
    * Initializes the `curses` window and sets up basic configurations.
    * Calls `load_modules()` to retrieve available analysis options.
    * Displays the main menu with numbered options.
    * Allows the user to navigate the menu using up/down arrow keys.
    * Executes the selected module's `run_analysis` function when Enter is pressed.
    * Handles exiting the application when 'q' is pressed.
* **`run_tui()`:**
    * Starts the TUI application by calling `main_menu()` wrapped in `curses.wrapper()` for proper initialization and termination of the curses environment.

**6. Dependencies:**

* **`curses`:** Provides the functionalities for creating the interactive TUI.
* **`importlib`:** Enables dynamic importing of modules at runtime.
* **`os`:** Used for interacting with the file system, specifically listing files in the "modules" directory.
* **`main` module:**  Assumed to contain functions:
    * `calculate_torus_stresses`: Likely responsible for calculating stresses within the torus.
    * `fatigue_analysis`:  Likely performs fatigue analysis based on calculated stresses.
    * `advanced_calculations`:  Potentially houses additional, more complex calculations related to torus analysis.
* **`visualization` module:** Assumed to contain the function:
    * `create_advanced_animation`:  Likely generates visualizations or animations based on the analysis results.

**7. Example Usage:**

1. Run the script.
2. A menu will appear in the terminal listing available analysis modules (e.g., "Stress Analysis", "Fatigue Life Prediction").
3. Use the up and down arrow keys to navigate to the desired analysis.
4. Press Enter to select and run the chosen analysis.
5. Follow the prompts or instructions provided by the selected module.
6. Press 'q' to quit the application.

**8. Important Notes or Caveats:**

* This script assumes a specific directory structure:
    * The "modules" directory should be present in the same directory as the script.
    * Each analysis module in "modules" should have a function named `run_analysis` that accepts `calculate_torus_stresses`, `fatigue_analysis`, `advanced_calculations`, and `create_advanced_animation` as arguments.
* The script relies on the `main` and `visualization` modules, which are not included in the provided code. Ensure these modules exist and contain the expected functions.
* The specific implementation details within each analysis module are not defined in the provided code.
