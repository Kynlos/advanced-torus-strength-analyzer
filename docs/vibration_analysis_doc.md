## Vibration Analysis Script Documentation

**1. Script Name:** vibration_analysis.py 

**2. Description:**

This Python script performs a basic vibration analysis of a torus (donut-shaped object). It calculates the natural frequencies and mode shapes of the torus based on user-provided geometric and material properties. The script uses simplified mass and stiffness matrices for the torus, providing an approximate solution.

**3. Usage:**

The script is intended to be run from the command line within a Python environment. When executed, it prompts the user to input the torus parameters. 

**4. Parameters:**

The script takes user input for the following parameters:

* **R (float):** Major radius of the torus.
* **r (float):** Minor radius of the torus.
* **t (float):** Thickness of the torus.
* **E (float):** Young's modulus of the torus material.
* **rho (float):** Density of the torus material.
* **nu (float):** Poisson's ratio of the torus material.

**5. Functions:**

* **`run_analysis(calculate_torus_stresses, fatigue_analysis, advanced_calculations, create_advanced_animation)`:**
    * This function drives the overall analysis process. 
    * It prompts the user for input parameters, calculates the mass and stiffness matrices, solves the eigenvalue problem, displays the natural frequencies, and calls the visualization function.
* **`calculate_matrices(R, r, t, E, rho, nu, n)`:**
    * This function calculates the simplified mass (M) and stiffness (K) matrices for the torus based on the provided parameters and the number of modes (n) to consider.
    * **Note:** The current implementation uses a simplified approximation for these matrices.
* **`create_advanced_animation(eigenvectors, R, r)`:**
    * **Placeholder function:**  This function is intended to visualize the calculated mode shapes of the torus.
    * Currently, it only prints a placeholder message. It requires implementation with a suitable visualization library (e.g., matplotlib) to generate animations or plots of the mode shapes.

**6. Dependencies:**

The script depends on the following Python libraries:

* **NumPy:** Used for numerical calculations, especially array operations and linear algebra.
* **SciPy:** Specifically, the `eigh` function from `scipy.linalg` is used to solve the eigenvalue problem.

**7. Example Usage:**

```
Enter major radius (R): 2
Enter minor radius (r): 0.5
Enter thickness (t): 0.1
Enter Young's modulus (E): 200e9
Enter density (rho): 7850
Enter Poisson's ratio (nu): 0.3

Natural Frequencies:
Mode 1: 123.45 Hz
Mode 2: 345.67 Hz
Mode 3: 567.89 Hz

**8. Important Notes and Caveats:**

* **Simplified Model:** The script employs a simplified model for calculating the mass and stiffness matrices, resulting in approximate natural frequencies and mode shapes. For more accurate results, a more sophisticated finite element analysis (FEA) approach would be necessary.
* **Visualization Placeholder:** The `create_advanced_animation` function currently acts as a placeholder. Implementing actual visualization requires utilizing a suitable library and incorporating the logic to interpret and display the mode shapes.
* **Module Imports:** The script includes imports from external modules (`main`, `modules`, `visualization`) within the `if __name__ == "__main__":` block. This suggests that the script is part of a larger project. Ensure these modules and their respective functions (`calculate_torus_stresses`, `fatigue_analysis`, `advanced_calculations`) are available and correctly implemented.
