## Torus Stress and Fatigue Analysis Script

**1. Script Name:** `torus_analysis.py` (You can choose a more descriptive name)

**2. Description:** 

This Python script calculates stresses and performs fatigue analysis on a thin-walled torus subjected to various loads and environmental conditions. It leverages advanced thin-walled torus theory to determine stresses caused by internal/external pressure, external forces, moments, and thermal expansion. The script also features a simplified S-N curve-based fatigue analysis module with Goodman mean stress correction to estimate the fatigue life of the torus.

**3. Usage:** 

The script is designed to be run from the command line and utilizes a text-based user interface (TUI) for input and output. 

**4. Parameters:** 

The script does not take any direct command-line parameters. All input parameters are provided through the TUI. The following parameters are required:

* **Torus Geometry:**
    * `R`: Torus major radius (m)
    * `r`: Torus minor radius (m)
    * `t`: Torus wall thickness (m)
* **Material Properties:**
    * `E`: Young's modulus (Pa)
    * `nu`: Poisson's ratio
    * `S_ut`: Ultimate tensile strength (Pa)
    * `alpha`: Thermal expansion coefficient (1/K) - optional, defaults to 12e-6 for steel
* **Loading Conditions:**
    * `p_int`: Internal pressure (Pa)
    * `p_ext`: External pressure (Pa)
    * `F_x`, `F_y`, `F_z`: External forces in x, y, and z directions (N)
    * `M_x`, `M_y`, `M_z`: External moments about x, y, and z axes (N.m)
    * `T`: Temperature change (K)
* **Fatigue Analysis:**
    * `sigma_max`: Maximum cyclic stress (Pa)
    * `sigma_min`: Minimum cyclic stress (Pa)
    * `N_cycles`: Number of cycles

**5. Functions:**

* **`calculate_torus_stresses(R, r, t, E, nu, p_int, p_ext, F_x, F_y, F_z, M_x, M_y, M_z, T, theta, phi)`:**

    * Calculates the stresses in the torus at a specific location defined by angles `theta` and `phi`.
    * Returns: Tuple containing von Mises stress, hoop stress, and longitudinal stress.
* **`fatigue_analysis(sigma_max, sigma_min, N_cycles, S_ut)`:**

    * Performs fatigue analysis based on the provided stress range and material properties.
    * Utilizes a simplified S-N curve approach with Goodman mean stress correction.
    * Returns: Damage value (ratio of applied cycles to cycles to failure).

**6. Dependencies:**

* `numpy`

**7. Example Usage:**

Run the script from the command line:

```bash
python torus_analysis.py
```

Follow the prompts in the TUI to input the required parameters for geometry, material properties, loading conditions, and fatigue analysis. The script will then output the calculated stresses and fatigue damage.

**8. Important Notes:**

* The script utilizes a simplified model for thin-walled torus stress analysis and fatigue. 
* The accuracy of the results depends on the validity of the thin-walled assumption and the chosen material model.
* The fatigue analysis is based on a simplified S-N curve and does not consider factors like stress concentrations, surface finish, and environmental effects. 
* Users should carefully interpret and validate the results based on their specific application and engineering judgment.

This documentation provides a comprehensive overview of the script's functionality. For detailed information on the underlying equations and assumptions, please refer to relevant engineering resources on thin-walled pressure vessel analysis and fatigue.
