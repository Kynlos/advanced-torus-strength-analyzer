##  Module: my_new_analysis

### Description
This is a template module for the Advanced Torus Strength Analyzer. It demonstrates how to create a new analysis module that integrates with the main application. 

This template can be used as a starting point for developing custom analysis features.

### Usage
This module is not intended to be run directly. It will be automatically loaded by the Advanced Torus Strength Analyzer and added to the main menu.

### Parameters (run_analysis function)
* **calculate_torus_stresses:** A function from the main application that calculates basic torus stresses. 
* **fatigue_analysis:** A function from the main application that performs fatigue analysis.
* **advanced_calculations:** A module containing functions for advanced calculations.
* **create_advanced_animation:** A function from the visualization module that creates animations based on analysis results.

### Functions

#### `run_analysis(calculate_torus_stresses, fatigue_analysis, advanced_calculations, create_advanced_animation)`
   - This is the main function that will be called when the module is selected from the main menu.
   - It interacts with the user, performs the analysis using helper functions, and displays the results. It can also utilize other modules and functions for visualization.
   - **Steps:**
      1.  Prompts the user for input parameters.
      2.  Calls `my_analysis_function` to perform the specific analysis.
      3.  Prints the analysis results.
      4.  Optionally, calls `create_advanced_animation` to visualize the results. 
      5.  Waits for user input before returning to the main menu.

#### `my_analysis_function(param1, param2)`
   - This is a placeholder function where you should implement your specific analysis logic.
   - **Replace:**
      - `param1`, `param2`:  Replace these with the actual parameters required by your analysis.
      - **Analysis Code:**  Replace the placeholder comment with your analysis code.
   - **Returns:**  The results of your analysis (the specific format depends on your implementation). 

### Dependencies
This module depends on the following:

* **NumPy:** A library for numerical computing in Python.
* **main:**  The main application script (presumably named 'main.py').
* **modules.advanced_calculations:** A module containing advanced calculation functions.
* **visualization:**  A module (presumably named 'visualization.py') containing functions for visualizations, including `create_advanced_animation`.

### Example Usage (within the Advanced Torus Strength Analyzer)
1. The user selects "My New Analysis" from the main menu.
2. The `run_analysis` function is called.
3. The user is prompted for input parameters.
4. The `my_analysis_function` is called with the provided parameters.
5. Results are calculated and displayed.
6. The user presses Enter to return to the main menu.

### Notes

* Remember to replace the placeholder comments in the `my_analysis_function` with your actual analysis code.
* You can add more functions to the module as needed.
* Ensure that all dependencies are installed before running the Advanced Torus Strength Analyzer.
* This template assumes a specific structure for the main application.  Adjust the imports and function calls if your application is structured differently.
