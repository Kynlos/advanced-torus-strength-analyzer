## Composite Material Analysis Script Documentation

**1. Script Name:** composite_analysis.py (This is an assumed name, as one was not provided)

**2. Description:** 

This script performs laminate analysis on a composite material composed of multiple layers. It takes user input for the material properties and orientation of each layer, calculates the overall stiffness matrix (ABD matrix), determines mid-plane strains and curvatures under given loads, and computes the stresses in each layer. The script can also be integrated with additional modules for advanced calculations and visualization.

**3. Usage:**

The script is designed to be run from the command line. It will prompt the user for input parameters.

**4. Parameters:**

The script itself doesn't take command-line parameters. Instead, it prompts the user for the following inputs for each layer of the composite material:

* **Number of layers:**  The total number of layers in the composite laminate.
* **Thickness:** The thickness of the layer.
* **Fiber orientation angle:**  The angle (in degrees) of the fibers in the layer relative to the global coordinate system.
* **E1:** Longitudinal Young's modulus of the layer material.
* **E2:** Transverse Young's modulus of the layer material.
* **G12:** In-plane shear modulus of the layer material.
* **nu12:** Major Poisson's ratio of the layer material.

**5. Functions:**

* **`run_analysis(calculate_torus_stresses, fatigue_analysis, advanced_calculations, create_advanced_animation)`:**
    - This is the main function that drives the script.
    - It prompts the user for input, performs the laminate analysis, displays the results, and optionally visualizes them.
    - It takes four function arguments that appear to be related to external modules: `calculate_torus_stresses`, `fatigue_analysis`, `advanced_calculations`, and `create_advanced_animation`.

* **`laminate_analysis(layers)`:**
    - Takes a list of tuples, where each tuple represents a layer and contains its properties (thickness, angle, E1, E2, G12, nu12).
    - Calculates the ABD matrix for the entire laminate.
    - Applies predefined loads and moments (can be modified within the function).
    - Solves for mid-plane strains and curvatures.
    - Calculates stresses in each layer.
    - Returns the ABD matrix, mid-plane strains/curvatures, and stresses in each layer.

* **`calculate_stiffness_matrix(E1, E2, G12, nu12)`:**
    - Takes the material properties of a layer as input.
    - Calculates the stiffness matrix (Q) for the material in its principal directions.
    - Returns the calculated stiffness matrix.

* **`transform_stiffness_matrix(Q, angle)`:**
    - Takes the stiffness matrix (Q) in principal directions and the fiber orientation angle as input.
    - Transforms the stiffness matrix from the principal material coordinate system to the global coordinate system.
    - Returns the transformed stiffness matrix (Q_bar).

**6. Dependencies:**

* **numpy:** Used for array and matrix operations.
* **scipy.linalg.solve:**  Used to solve the linear system of equations for strains and curvatures.
* **main (module):**  This module likely contains the `calculate_torus_stresses` and `fatigue_analysis` functions.
* **modules (package):** This package likely contains the `advanced_calculations` module.
* **visualization (module):**  This module likely contains the `create_advanced_animation` function.

**7. Example Usage:**

The script will guide the user through the input process. Here is a general outline:

1. Run the script from the command line.
2. Enter the number of layers when prompted.
3. For each layer, enter the requested material properties and fiber orientation angle.
4. The script will print the calculated ABD matrix, mid-plane strains and curvatures, and stresses in each layer.

**8. Important Notes and Caveats:**

* The script currently uses predefined values for loads and moments. These should be modified within the `laminate_analysis` function or adapted to take user inputs for more general use cases.
* The accuracy of the analysis depends on the validity of the input parameters and the assumptions of classical laminate theory.
* This script appears to be part of a larger project involving modules for "main," "modules," and "visualization."  These modules need to be accessible in the same directory or in the Python path for the script to function correctly.  More information about these modules would be needed for a complete understanding of the script's functionality.
