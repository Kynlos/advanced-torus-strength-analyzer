## Torus Stress Visualization and Fatigue Analysis Script

**1. Script Name:** torus_stress_animation.py 

**2. Description:** 

This Python script visualizes the stress distribution on a torus under combined loading conditions. It utilizes the finite element method to calculate stresses and animates the results for better understanding. Additionally, it performs fatigue analysis based on the calculated stresses and provided material properties.

**3. Usage:** 

This script is intended to be run within a Python environment with the necessary dependencies installed. It requires a set of input variables defining the torus geometry, material properties, loading conditions, and analysis parameters. These variables should be provided in the script prior to calling the `create_advanced_animation` function.

**4. Parameters:**

The script takes no direct command-line parameters. Instead, it relies on pre-defined variables within the script. These variables include:

* **Geometric Variables:**
    * `R`: Major radius of the torus
    * `r`: Minor radius of the torus
    * `t`: Thickness of the torus
* **Material Properties:**
    * `E`: Young's modulus
    * `nu`: Poisson's ratio
    * `S_ut`: Ultimate tensile strength
    * `yield_stress`: Yield stress of the material
    * `n`: Fatigue strength exponent
    * `K_IC`: Fracture toughness (for future development)
* **Loading Conditions:**
    * `p_int`: Internal pressure
    * `p_ext`: External pressure
    * `F_x`, `F_y`, `F_z`: Forces in X, Y, and Z directions
    * `M_x`, `M_y`, `M_z`: Moments about X, Y, and Z axes
    * `T`: Temperature
* **Analysis Parameters:**
    * `N_cycles`: Number of loading cycles for fatigue analysis
* **Other Variables:**
    * `T_inner`, `T_outer`: Inner and outer temperatures (currently unused)
    * `rho`: Density (currently unused)
    * `omega`: Angular velocity (currently unused)

**5. Functions and Their Purposes:**

* **`create_advanced_animation(variables, failure_criteria, calculate_torus_stresses, fatigue_analysis)`:** This is the main function responsible for:
    - Extracting input variables from the provided list.
    - Generating the torus geometry and mesh.
    - Calling the `calculate_torus_stresses` function to obtain stress components.
    - Calculating fatigue damage using the `fatigue_analysis` function.
    - Creating and animating the 3D stress visualization and 2D stress distribution plots.

* **`calculate_torus_stresses(R, r, t, E, nu, p_int, p_ext, F_x, F_y, F_z, M_x, M_y, M_z, T, theta, phi)`:** This function is responsible for calculating the stress components (von Mises, hoop, and meridional) at each point on the torus surface based on the provided geometry, material properties, and loading conditions.

* **`fatigue_analysis(sigma_max, sigma_min, N_cycles, S_ut)`:** This function calculates the fatigue damage based on the provided stress range, number of cycles, and material properties. It likely utilizes a fatigue damage model like S-N curve or strain-life approach.

**6. Dependencies:**

The script relies on the following Python libraries:

* **NumPy:** Used for numerical calculations and array manipulations.
* **Matplotlib:** Used for plotting and animation.
    * **`matplotlib.pyplot`:** Provides plotting functionality.
    * **`matplotlib.animation.FuncAnimation`:** Enables animation of plots.
    * **`mpl_toolkits.mplot3d.Axes3D`:** Allows for 3D plotting.

**7. Example Usage:**

```python
# Define input variables (example values)
variables = [
    ('R', 100),
    ('r', 20),
    # ... define other variables
]

# Define failure criteria (example value)
failure_criteria = 200e6

# Import or define the required functions (calculate_torus_stresses, fatigue_analysis)

# Call the main function to create the animation
create_advanced_animation(variables, failure_criteria, calculate_torus_stresses, fatigue_analysis)
```

**8. Important Notes and Caveats:**

* The functions `calculate_torus_stresses` and `fatigue_analysis` are not fully defined within this script and require user implementation or importing from external modules.
* The script currently ignores the effects of temperature variations, density, and angular velocity. 
* The accuracy of the analysis depends heavily on the chosen methods for stress calculation and fatigue analysis.
* Further development can include:
    * Implementing user-defined mesh density and element type.
    * Incorporating different failure criteria.
    * Adding options to export animation as a video file.
    * Implementing more sophisticated fatigue analysis methods.
